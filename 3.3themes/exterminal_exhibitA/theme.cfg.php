# Ampache Theme: exterminal: exhibitA 
###########################

# Notes
# i wrote this theme because i was inspired by exterminal.net and wanted
# to make a sci-fi looking theme.  this is the second theme i've made with 
# this look (see: exterminal).  i wanted to do something that looked a bit 
# more artistic and colorful and made more use of using png instead of gif
# for the ampache logo.  i used some of apex's icons from the apex and 
# aphelion themes.
