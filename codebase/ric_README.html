1. Intro:

  Ampache is a PHP-based interface to a MySQL database 
  where information about your audio files are stored.  The songs 
  are streamed using PHP; older versions required mod_mp3 but this
  version no longer does.  The songs are cataloged via PHP
  scripts.

  These tools are heavily dependent on quality tags in your audio
  files and or the file system organization. If you&#039;ve kept them 
  up-to-date or organized this is the tool for you.  
  
  See CHANGELOG for version information.

2. Getting all the components

  Apache &gt;= 2.2.x http://www.apache.org OR other web server
  PHP &gt;= 5.2.x http://www.php.net ** (high recommended for 5.3.x)
  	PHP5-Mysql
	PHP5-Session
	PHP5-gd (recommended)
	PHP5 ICONV 
	PHP5 ZLIB support (recommended)
  MySQL &gt;= 5.x+ http://www.mysql.com

  ** PHP 5.3.x is required for Windows systems due to use of inet_pton
     and inet_aton functions.

3. Setting Up

  Please see the included INSTALL file or if possible the wiki
  for the most update to date instructions, http://ampache.org/wiki

3a. Upgrading Your Ampache Install

  If you are upgrading from an older version of Ampache we recommend
  moving the old directory out of the way, extracting the new copy in 
  its place and then copying the old config file. All database updates
  will be handled by the /update.php script. There is no need to insert
  the /sql/ampache.sql if you have an existing installation.

  Please see MIGRATION for specific instructions based on the version
