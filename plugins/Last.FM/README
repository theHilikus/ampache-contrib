This is a crappy readme for the LAST.FM plugin

Known Issues
* Last.FM fails to insert on 'unknown' artists as in, artists it doesn't think are real
* Last.FM fails to insert due to timeouts (Their site fails to respond) 
* Last.FM doesn't accept non-us chars correctly (UTF-8 seems to 'look funny' on their website) 

Installing
1) Put the .plugin.php file in /modules/plugins
2) Run patch -p1 < Lastfm.patch from the root of your Ampache dir
3) In the interface go to Admin -> Modules and activate the Last.FM plugin
4) Set your Username/Pass in Preferences -> Options 

Enjoy!
