// The reciver can hang or reboot on large queries. Use this setting to specify a Query Limit.
	// eg. query_limit=3000 to limit large queries to 3000 entries. This is the default.
	// The breaking point varies possibly depending on specific data returned and usage conditions (that use cache etc.?)

// RECEIVER STATS
// ==============
	// You can treat each receiver as individual ampache users, or group all receivers into a single user.
	// All usernames must be valid, existing ampache users.
	// Basically this tries to make a receiver behave like a specific ampache user, and share stats and ACLs etc. with it.
	
	// First you have to enable receiver stats.
		// If disabled, ampache will not track any play stats or impose any sort of filters on the receivers, in
		// which case the unit is simply levraging ampache's database, but operating outside of ampache itself.
		//
		// This will associate a receiver with an ampache user (more details below) and try to associate as many
		// user specifc preferences as possible including 'most popular' lists, playlists and eventually ACLs etc.
		// If you set track_receiver_stats=1, then you must configure the rest of this section. Otherwise this section is ignored.
		// 0=Disable
		// 1=Enable (default)
		
		track_receiver_stats=1


	// Next you must specify if you want to assocaiate each with specific ampache users as individuals,
	// or group alll receivers to a single ampache user.
		// Note that for individual receiver association this to be reliable, your DHCP server should be configured to always
		// assign a specific IP to a specifc receiver, based on it's MAC address. Otherwise a receiver could have multiple IPs,
		// or IPs could bounce between receivers, in which case tracking individually will be ineffective.
		// 0=Track receivers individually (default)
		// 1=Group receivers together
		
		group_receivers_together=0
	
	
	// Next you must specify if you want ampache to automatically create the users to associate the receivers with.
		// If enabled, then whenever a new unit is seen, an associated ampache user will be created, if it doesn't already exist.
		// If you have specifed the username in this config file, that username will be used, otherwise a default
		// username will be created in the form of 'rio-<dotted_ip_address>', like 'rio-192.168.0.10'
		// If you specified group_receivers_together=1, then a user for the IP '0.0.0.0' will be created.
		// Automatically created users will have their access level set as 'disabled' and a random password will be set, since
		// the receiver doesn't actually 'log in'.
		// If you want to modify the user access level or password you can do so in the ampache web interface as any Admin user.
		// If you do not enable this setting, then you MUST specify all receivers by IP (or 0.0.0.0) and assign a username,
		// which you've previously created in ampache.
		// 0=User will manually create receiver-mappings and manually create those user accounts
		// 1=Users will be automatically created for new units (default)
		//
		// NOTE: If you let users be automatically created, the rest of this setup is easy and can be ignored
		// otherwise it's up to you to make everything work the way you want.
		// 0=You have to create ampache users manually for the receivers
		// 1=Users will be automatically created for you (default)
		
		automatically_create_users=1
	
	
	// Finally you specify each of your receivers and an associated ampache username to assign their play stats to.
		// If you specified automatically_create_users=0, you MUST do this for each receiver.
		// otherwise you can simply let the system auto-create the users with default usernames.
		// Remember, if you set group_receivers_together=1, then you MUST create an entry for 0.0.0.0
		// if you also specified automatically_create_users=0
		// The format is:
		//   rio_user_<dotted_ip_address_of_receiver>=<ampache_username>
		//
		// eg:
		// rio_user_0.0.0.0=rio			(special address for group_receivers_together=1)
		// rio_user_192.168.0.10=bedroom
		//
		// If not user specified, any automatically created username will be 'rio-<dotted_ip_address>'
		// eg:
		// 'all receivers if grouped' would be 'rio-0.0.0.0'
		// '192.168.0.10' would be 'rio-192.168.0.10'
		//
		// Note: You can specify an existing ampache user, to update that user's stats as well as inherit it's Most Popular lists etc.
	
		rio_user_0.0.0.0=rio





// DYNAMIC PLAYLISTS
// -----------------
// These playlists are generated on the fly based on usage data and newest album info etc. in the
// same manner as those in the ampache web interface.
// For each playlist, specify the maximum number of entries you want to be retreived for that list.
// Setting a particular playlist to 0 removes it from the UI entirely
// Note that in order to use 'user' spcific playlists, you must have track_receiver_stats=1 above

	playlist_global_most_popular_songs=50
	playlist_user_most_popular_songs=50
	
	
	// These playlists contain each track from the album.
	// The value indicates how many albums you want on the list. You can have up to 100 each.
	
	// They are preceded by a 3-letter code to indicate what type it is:
	// new - Newest Albums
	// gAl - Most Popular Albums (Global)
	// gAr - Most Popular Artists (Global)
	// uAl - Most Popular Albums (User)
	// uAr - Most Popular Artists (User)

	playlist_dividers=1 
	



// FAVORITES
// ---------
// You can dynamically populate the "favorites" list, acessible via the "List" button on the receiver's
// remote control. This list can have up to 100 entries TOTAL, a limitiation of the hardware. Only the first
// 100 entries will be used.
// Specify how many of each type you want to appear on the list.
