This is optional!
But it improves accessability and better fits in ampache installations using themes by me.

Copy the files includes in this folder to ampaches root to the appropriate folders.
They include some patches to ampache 3.3.3.2 for login page, album listing and some other things.
They'll work fine until included/fixed (maybe) in the next version of ampache.
They are not necessary but improve look & feel.

Thanks to blueorder and andy90 for help on some patches ;)
