This theme was made by Apex. I can be contacted at
apexeleven@gmail.com, but I may take some time to
reply as I check this inbox only occassionaly.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Copy folder "apogee" to your themes directory.

2. IF YOU WANT THE PRETTY ICONS

   A. Go to the "images" folder inside your ampache
      installation.

   B. Copy everything inside the "Icons" folder I
      provided into "/ampache/images" Overwrite
      existing files (back them up first if you
      want to).

3. Copy "nonstep.ttf" into your "C:/WINDOWS/fonts/"
   directory. If your a linux user, well you should
   know how to install fonts yourself (Google is your
   friend)

   This theme will probably look like shite without
   nonstep.

4. Make sure you are using a new enough version of
   ampache! (SVN 722 or 3.3.3-alpha3 or newer and
   Firefox 1.4+. This theme does NOT work well with
   IE yet. I'm working on it.



NOTE: This theme requires a couple recently introduced
      changes to core components. If stuff is broken,
      you can either update to a SVN build, or live
      with the glitches here and there, and the lack of
      a footer until the next stable release.

      It should be perfectly usable without upgrading
      to SVN, however I will not be responsible for any
      thing that doesn't work or look right if your not
      using at least SVN Revision 721 or newer.
      (or 3.3.3-alpha3 or later when it is released)



Feel free to use my css template for your own theme.
Stuff is more commented and organized than the
default file, however some things are hacked around
a bit.

The main things to watch out for, is this is hacked
up for a centered layout, while other themes use a
left aligned layout. Also, this layout has a few
wonky issues with the menu bar, requiring a negative
top position. This should work in modern browsers
but may break really old ones.

      
      Thats it!
      
      Enjoy.
