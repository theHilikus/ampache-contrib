	This ampache theme does not use any graphics in generating the backgrounds, so the colors can be changed to
whatever you want.  The main feature of this theme is the borders.  The borders can easily be customized at the
top of themes/borders/templates/style.inc. There is a primary border around all the boxes, and a relief line across
the top and the left side.

	This them will overide your font with "Comic Sans MS".  This can be disabled in the top of the file
themes/borders/templates/style.inc.  It also tells you how to get this font in linux.  

	This theme was created against svn 577

Issues

1. If you use black (or something real dark) as a color;
	If you set your background (bg_color1) to black, some of the text wont be readable, especially on mouseover.
	If your background is black you will lose the shading and some text on themes/borders/images/ampache.gif.
		this is the image at the top of the page.
	If you set most frames (row_color3) to black, you should replace themes/borders/images/blankalbum.gif
