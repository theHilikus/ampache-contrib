# Ampache Theme: Empires 
###########################

# Notes
# This theme is based off a Joomla! template called js_empire.
# I've been running the 3.3.2 Ampache with this color scheme
# hard-coded in preferences for a while and decided it was time
# to make a new theme, and make it work with the new Ampache.
#
# 01/15/07 updated to include color scheming for user_offline/
# user_online classes, removed some no-longer-used stuff from
# this file, changed the blank-ampache.gif.

# Theme Name
# This is the actual name of the theme that
# will be displayed in the preferences screen
# DEFAULT: ampache-theme
name = "Empires"

# Theme Author
# This is just a way of giving credit to the 
# person who actually created this theme
# DEFAULT: N/A
author = "jazzs3quence"

# Theme Maintainer
# This is just a way of listing who is responsible for
# maintaining this theme incase it's not working right
# please include an e-mail address so you can be contacted
# DEFAULT: N/A
maintainer = "jazzs3quence -- c dot s dot reynolds at gmail dot com"

# Version
# This is the version of the Theme (usefull if you've updated it)
version = "1.3.1"

# Orientation
# This was added as of 3.3.2-Alpha4, this tells Ampache if this theme
# uses vertical or horizontal orientation of the menu, if this is a horizontal 
# theme then it will not show the quick search and quick random play forms
orientation = "horizontal"

# Submenu
# If this is set to simple the sub menu's will only be shown when you're on one of the 
# respective pages. If you want to make the menu's something like the classic theme
# comment this out
# submenu = "simple"
