# Ampache Theme: exterminal 
###########################

# Notes
# i wrote this theme because i was inspired by exterminal.net and wanted
# to make a sci-fi looking theme.  also, i'm depressed that no one continued
# the simple matrix theme that was for ampache 3.2 and never got fixed up
# for 3.3.  i used some of apex's icons from the apex and aphelion themes.
# ALSO:
# i had issues with the transparency for ampache.gif.  so i tweaked the header.inc
# to use ampache.png.  i've provided a hacked an unhacked copy.  just copy the 
# included header.inc to your /templates folder.  if you want to use a different
# theme, copy the header.inc.bak to /templates and rename it to header.inc
