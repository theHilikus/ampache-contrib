Info
----
This is my Simple Matrix theme. I've used Nedko Arnaudov's 'Black' theme as a
base and then started modifying it from there. The images are made by
myself, I hope you like them :-D.


Installation
------------
Just like all other themes, with the exception of the logo; I've included
the PSD file for it so you can easily fill in your own name / title in
PhotoShop. Then save it as 'ampache.gif' in the images folder (overwriting
the old one). The default image reads a generic 'Ampache, for the love of
music' so there's no need to change it if you don't have photoshop / don't
want to. If you use this theme then please inform me, any comments are
welcome too!
